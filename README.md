A simple implementation of Reversi in Java that allows both human and automated players.

## Changing Players
Currently, to change the players that are used when playing Reversi, you must edit the <code>main</code> method in the Reversi class.

Please do not commit this change to the Reversi class.

Use this mode if you want to see if one AI performs better than another AI.

To use competition mode, run the game with the "-t" flag followed by the number of games to run.
